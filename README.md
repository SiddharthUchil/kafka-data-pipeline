# kafka-data-pipeline
The project is about designing a data ingestion pipeline using Kafka. I have used Kafka topics managed on Confluent Cloud and set up a consumer and producer for the sensor data.

# Project Summary
I have used Kafka topics managed on Confluent Cloud and set up a consumer and producer for the sensor data. The project uses sensor data from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. The test set contains 16000 examples. There are 171 attributes per record.
